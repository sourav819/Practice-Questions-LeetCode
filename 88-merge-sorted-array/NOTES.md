â€‹i is pointing at the last prsent element of num1
j is pointing at the last element of num2
k is pointing at the last index of num1 vector
compare the last element of num1 and num2 and place the bigger element in k
if j reaches 0-> all elements of num2 are palced in correct position in num1
if i reaches 0-> all elements of num1 are greater than num2, place remaining elements of num2 in it's correct place
